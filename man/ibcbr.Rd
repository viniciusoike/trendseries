\description{
A \code{tibble} containing the seasonally adjusted Central Bank Economic Activity
Index (IBC-Br).
}
\details{
The IBC-Br was built based on proxies for the evolution of
agriculture, industry and service-sector products. The proxies are aggregated
with weights derived from the tables of supply and use of the Brazilian
National Accounts.

The seasonal adjustment is performed with the X13-ARIMA-SEATS software
and includes level change and temporary level change outliers in the last
quarter of 2008, a standard regressor for leap year and calendar regressors
for the monthly composition of week days controlled for the effect of
national holidays.
